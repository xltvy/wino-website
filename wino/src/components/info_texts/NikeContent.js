                As children growing up in a culture where the street is the home of all our memories and dance 
                is a part of every celebration, yet we went to the places we needed to reach and always come back 
                again to our community, to the neighborhood with the Air Force 1.

                Here is Gen Z, the newest generation of those who feel timeless (1A). Unique working rules, 
                liberating perception of beauty, completely different ways of self-expression. They know a 
                place beyond what is right or wrong, what is desired or boring. We will meet them there, 
                together with Elements of Dance (EoD) & other communities.
