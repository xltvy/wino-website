                We started our journey with Bodhita by embracing the meaning of its name.
                In Hinduism, Bodhita means rebirth, and the one who is awakened; is enlightened. 
                The name of the brand also talks about the liberation of the soul, getting
                out of the monotony and routine of life. And this one reminded us directly of the Phoenix.
                The rebirth of the phoenix from its ashes has become an outlet for us. Rebirth occurs when
                a person realizes his shortcomings and reaches full awareness. For this reason, the bird
                in the logo appears as a half. On the back of some boxes, we see works of art depicting places
                resembling old fairy-tale cities. And this place represents the place where our half-bird was born again.
