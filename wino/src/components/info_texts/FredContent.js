                When we started our journey with Fred, we had our favorite words about design from Charles Eames on our minds:
                "The details are not the details. They make the design." We aim to be able to design compositions in which
                details work for the whole, but each detail retains its own identity. "Harmony, nobility, and power* are
                three things that come to mind when we set out to build a brand. Then comes "simplicity, joy, and sincerity”.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Starting from here, we wanted to deliver the rarest coffee beans in the world to you with a communication
                language that can clearly express them. We decided to take this labor-intensive journey of coffee to a
                completely different point by crowning it with the designs we made. We have realized five different designs
                for five special coffees that touch the story of each one. The first of the packages was for a package
                called Women Farmers. The seeds were collected only from the farms where women farmers work. This situation
                is aimed at shaping a social responsibility project in the future. The design of this packaging consists of
                two female figures floating down to Earth in two separate landscapes where the sun rises and sets. "Wherever
                the sun rises and sets: We are bound by the honor of labor. the phrase completely explains our idea that
                we started with the designs we created for Fred. And the back of this design we placed the “Welcome My Women”
                poem by Nazım Hikmet. "Classical" package has a separate weight. In this way, the integrity that will come after
                it is formed on the axis of the classic. If such a design is made, we think it is genderless when choosing colors,
                and timeless when it comes to shapes and general perception.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The “Dream” package has a different story for us. In the process of designing this box, we came across
                the documentary "Dancing with Birds", which impressed us deeply and was our inspiration. We were very
                impressed by the beautiful birds gliding through nature and reviewed the design and colors before the last edition.
                First, we aimed to get as close to nature as we could in the design of Fred boxes. The colors we approached
                on this trip were matte and pastel shades. But we were very impressed by the bright and dazzling plumage of
                the animals each other. And we decided to add that brightness to our route. Our purpose became to protect a soft,
                slightly sweet experience, while visually drawing a calm, feminine image.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The impact of definitions on design is profound. We find options where high-performance products are decked out
                in intermediate tones intrinsically wrong. As the concept of concentrate is an expression that describes density,
                away from transparency; the label of the product also directly describes its color density and scale. After that,
                starting from the axis of that color, the process of expressive creation of the desired perception begins. For example,
                the nature of the performance, which offers a powerful and velvety drinking experience, blends with the forms of trees
                used to create coolness at the bedside of monarchs pictured in ancient times.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In this journey, our main goal was to be able to communicate with the consumer in a visual way that could be
                understood and felt during this special journey through packaging.
