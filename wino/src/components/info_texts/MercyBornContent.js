            <p>We are the universe. This idea was our departure point for shaping the brand philosophy. First of all, we started with the name of the brand, “Mercy Born, Artisan Skin Care Made To Reborn”. In this case, we emphasized the idea of a compassionate approach to the skin by integrating the action of rebirth with skin care. This approach was born out of the fact that products serve as a supporter to reach the best version of yourself. A fresh start to achieve your best version.  For Mercy Born we decided to bring a new perspective to the skin care industry with a deeper and philosophical approach that shapes the brand identity.  Pretentious Calmness  We reflected a calm aura based on the nudity of nature and the freedom of the universe. We aimed to create this aura on the packaging with a balanced color system and a unique design system. In the first place, we gave this aura with the color plate we created.   Then we followed a path that supports the idea of the body as an ambassador and placed a pretentious drawing on the external packaging. We placed a silhouette of a naked woman crouching down and giving herself up to nature.</p>
