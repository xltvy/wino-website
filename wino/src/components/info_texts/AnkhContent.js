                We have started our journey, and we have taken our inspiration from the depths of history and mythology
                as if it would tell a deep story. We see two main illustrated figures in this brand, Pegasus, and Simurg, 
                where we aim to capture the harmony brought by contrast. The harmony of these contrasts emphasizes the 
                importance of catching this harmony also in our daily lives. We have created this identity based on two 
                genderless characters and processed it with precision so that it can appeal to everyone.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The story we created through the dance of these two characters was one of the most basic elements that
                gave the spirit of our work. Yin Yang, the far eastern philosophical concept that describes how complementary,
                interconnected, and interdependent opposites can be in the natural world, has formed our main idea in linking
                our concepts and techniques during our creation process. Inspired by the Japanese ink style, we revived the
                pegasus and Simurg characters and enriched the branding with the eye, and checkerboard elements that we
                drew in the same technique.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Our reasons for choosing colors were that the brand included both gold and silver products.
                We can say that jewelry has become a guide to colors.
